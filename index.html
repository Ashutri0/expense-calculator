            <h2>Smart Expense Tracker for Monthly Income and Expense Management</h2>

            <p>
                Managing personal finances becomes easier when you have a simple and reliable expense tracker.
                This expense tracker app is designed to help you record, analyze, and manage your monthly income
                and expenses without any complexity. Whether you are tracking daily spending, monitoring outgoing
                payments, or recording incoming money, this tool gives you complete control over your finances.
           
                With an intuitive interface, you can add expenses with clear descriptions, dates, and amounts.
                The editable month selector allows you to switch between different months, making it easy to track
                expenses over time. All expense records are displayed in a structured table where you can edit or
                delete entries whenever needed. This flexibility makes the app suitable for personal budgeting,
                freelancers, students, and small business owners.
           
                The summary cards provide an instant overview of your financial health by showing total incoming,
                total outgoing, and the remaining balance. This helps you understand your spending habits and
                make informed financial decisions. Since all data is stored securely in your browser using local
                storage, your information remains private and accessible even after refreshing or reopening the page.
                No account creation or internet connection is required.
            
                One of the key features of this expense tracker is the ability to export your expense records as a
                PDF file. You can download a detailed expense report for the selected month and share it easily
                or keep it for future reference. The built-in print support allows you to print your income and
                expense records directly from the browser, making it ideal for offline documentation or budgeting
                reviews.
            
                This monthly expense tracker acts as a lightweight budget planner that helps you stay organized,
                reduce unnecessary spending, and improve financial discipline. By tracking both income and outgoing
                expenses in one place, you gain clarity and confidence in managing your money. Whether your goal is
                saving more, controlling expenses, or simply understanding where your money goes, this expense
                tracking app provides a practical and efficient solution.
